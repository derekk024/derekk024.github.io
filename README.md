# derekk024.github.io

Personal portfolio site for selected projects in quantitative research, software engineering, and machine learning.

I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics student at UCLA. I like building end-to-end systems to solve problems.

## What you’ll find here
- Selected projects from my resume (public writeups + limited code where appropriate)
- Short technical notes on design choices and evaluation
- Links to demos, reports, and reproducible subsets of work

Some projects are intentionally partial (for privacy or because they’re part of ongoing work). When that’s the case, I share the approach, experiments, and results I can stand behind without leaking anything sensitive.

## Projects

### Rebellion Research — RL Volatility Hedging (BTC / GLD)
Reinforcement learning pipeline for volatility hedging using market data, with walk-forward evaluation and a focus on out-of-sample robustness.

- Topics: RL, time-series, backtesting, evaluation discipline
- Stack: Python, PyTorch (and supporting infra)
- Repo: https://github.com/derekk024/Public-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Volatility-Hedging-A-Dual-Asset-Strategy-Using-Bitcoin-and-Gold
- Writeup: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5399564

### Algorithmic Equity Trading (Selected Components)
A research and engineering project around systematic equity trading. I’m only publishing non-sensitive parts (evaluation approach and limited strategy components).

- Topics: research workflow, data validation, backtesting design, risk controls
- What’s public: nothing for now
- What’s not public: everything for now
- Repo / notes: soon

### LSTM Forecasting + Tree-Based Model (Python)
Time-series prediction work combining an LSTM-based model and a tree-based classifier for decision support. Focus on feature design, leakage avoidance, and evaluation.

- Topics: supervised learning, feature engineering, train/test discipline
- Stack: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Repo: https://github.com/derekk024/Decision-Tree-Price-Prediction

### A Quantitative Framework for Assessing Wide Receiver Blocking Effectivenss Using Player Tracking Data
Selected work from my resume related to BSA. Posting a short writeup and any safe artifacts (documentation, analysis, or a reproducible subset).

- Repo: https://github.com/derekk024/BSAFinal/tree/main
- Writeup: https://github.com/derekk024/BSAFinal/blob/main/A%20Quantitative%20Framework%20for%20Assessing%20Wide%20Receiver%20Blocking%20Effectiveness%20Using%20Player%20Tracking%20Data.pdf
