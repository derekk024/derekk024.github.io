# derekk024.github.io

Personal portfolio site for selected projects in quantitative research, software engineering, and machine learning.

Hi I'm Frank Kronewitter. I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics student at UCLA. I like building end-to-end systems to solve problems.

## What you’ll find here
- Selected projects from my resume (public writeups + limited code where appropriate)
- Short technical notes on design choices and evaluation
- Links to demos, reports, and reproducible subsets of work

Some projects are intentionally partial (for privacy or because they’re part of ongoing work). When that’s the case, I share the approach, experiments, and results I can stand behind without leaking anything sensitive.

## Projects

### Rebellion Research — RL Volatility Hedging (BTC / GLD)
Reinforcement learning pipeline for volatility hedging using market data, with walk-forward evaluation and a focus on out-of-sample robustness.

- Topics: RL, time-series, backtesting, evaluation discipline
- Stack: Python, PyTorch (and supporting infra)

### Algorithmic Equity Trading (Selected Components)
A research and engineering project around systematic equity trading. I’m only publishing non-sensitive parts (evaluation approach and limited strategy components).

- Topics: research workflow, data validation, backtesting design, risk controls
- What’s public: An example machine learning ticker sector strategy and evaluation.
- What’s not public: The entire domain of tickers traded
